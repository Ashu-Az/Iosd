# Iosd 

In this project , I implement a support vector machine (SVM) model to predict the hazardous objects which are close to the earth.


## Task 1 
Implement kernel SVM for classification and provide a comparative study using different kernels(linear, polynomial, gaussian, sigmoid, RBF etc) using precision and f1-scores.

## Documentation
In the Task 1 
1). After importing required dependies , I checked basic info about the dataset .
2). Then i did analysis of the correlated data , I removed some unwanted columns to make the model more clear.
3). After removing the unnecessary attributes , i used one hot encoding technique to divide the target value in two attributes to train the model.
4). After preparing required dataset , I did stastical analysis and data visualization 
5). Then i divided training and test datasets to train the model and implemented support vector machine (svm) kernels to do a comparative study between them




## Task 2
Try implementing a neural net for the above dataset as a binary classifier. You may use any AI library[*] like scikit, Tensorflow, pyTorch etc.

## Intuition
In Task 2 , I implemented aritificial neural networl using tensorflow and keras
* after implementing the neural network , i evaluated ANN efficiency using precision and recall
